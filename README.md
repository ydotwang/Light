# Project Title: Light

## Description
**Light** is a single-player RPG adventure game developed by Yuyang Wang and the team. It is a top-down shooter with puzzles set in a distant future on a different planet inhabited by droids. A sudden power outage leaves most droids inoperable, and the remaining droids must overcome numerous obstacles to find a new power source.

This project is an updated version of an older project by Prof. Stacy Doore.

## Features
- **AI Ghosts:** Coded AI ghosts that can chase and attack the player while patrolling.
- **Puzzle Design:** Designed puzzles with laser emitters, mirrors, and sensors.
- **Soundtrack:** Created soundtracks for puzzle-solving and combat parts, and added sound effects for various game actions.
- **Game Testing:** Tested the game and recorded a 14-minute demo video.

## Contributions
- **AI Behavior Tree:** Using Unreal Engine 5, created tasks for ghost AI, including patrolling, moving to random locations, and chasing the player.
- **Soundtrack Creation:** Used Garageband to make an exciting combat soundtrack and a mysterious, quiet puzzle-solving soundtrack.
- **Game Testing and Demo:** Recorded a game demo video available on Bilibili.
